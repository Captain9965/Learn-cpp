/*

It is a set of cpp template classes that provide common programming data structures and 
functions such as lists , stacks and arrays.
It is a library of container classes, algorithms and iterators

Algorithms provide a set of functions that are designed to be used on a range of elements
they operate on containers

container objects store data and objects. There are 7 standard "first class" container classes and 3 container adapter classes...
    Types of conainers:
        1. sequence containers:
            implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner
        2. container adaptors:
            They provide a different interface for sequential containers
        3. Associative containers:
            They implement sorted data structures that can quickly be searched.
        4. Unordered associative containers:
            Implement unordered data structures that can quickly be searched
Functors:
    the stl include classes that overload the function call operator. They allow the working of the associated function to be 
    customized with the help of the parameters to be passed.
Iterators:
    they allow for working on a sequence of values. they allow generality in STL.
