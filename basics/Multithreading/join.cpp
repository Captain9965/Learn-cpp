/*
The pthread_join() subroutine blocks the calling thread until the specified 'threadid' thread terminates. When a thread is created, one of its attributes defines whether it is joinable or detached. 
Only threads that are created as joinable can be joined.
 If a thread is created as detached, it can never be joined.
